<p>You know your organization can perform at a higher level if you can figure out how to strategically use new technology. For example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Become a data-driven organization by using analytics and exploring machine learning/AI</li>
  <li>Strategically embrace augmented and virtual reality</li>
</ul>

<p>But you’ve been burned before. You’ve seen tech fads eat up a lot of resources without helping your organization achieve its goals.</p>

<p>Why do most tech transformations fail? The key driver isn’t tech but people — problems with management, processes, organizational culture, and internal politics.</p>

<p>At Enode, we’re tech experts but we also understand the critical importance of focusing on people.</p>

<p>Whether you’re a tech manager, a marketing director, or a CEO, we can help you build on your organization’s strengths and find a smarter way to use new technology to “level up” your organization.</p>

<ul>
  <li>For the technology you want your organization to adopt, such as data science or augmented/virtual reality, we’ll help you flesh out your goals and assumptions; assess your organization’s technical, organizational, and cultural strengths &amp; weaknesses; and briefly map out where the field is headed.</li>
  <li>We’ll provide you with some options and a recommendation so you can choose a strategy that best fits your organization’s goals and capacity.</li>
  <li>We’ll collaboratively develop a roadmap and a plan that gets your feet wet, rack up some small wins, then iteratively builds success on top of success.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="coaching-and-project-management">Coaching and Project Management</h3>
