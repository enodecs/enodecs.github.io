You know your organization can perform at a higher level if you can figure out how to more effectively use technology. Here's how Enode Consulting Services can help:

### Onboarding or Revamping  Your EveryAction/VAN Site

Starting from scratch with EveryAction and VAN or need to transform your existing setup?  I've got years of experience as a contractor for the company now known as Bonterra and have helped dozens of large and small nonprofits get more out of these organizing and fundraising tools. Clients have included NEA, America Votes, State Voices, Working Families Party, Amnesty International, United Way NY, La Familia Vota, Civic Nation, Equality Utah, ACLU Massachusetts, Indiana Voices, Alliance for Justice, MASSCreative, and North Carolina Justice Center.

### Implementing, Adopting, Or Transforming Software

**Implement and Adopt Software.** Need someone to plan and manage the implementation of a new software system?  Could you use some help in taking the system you spent so much time developing but still hasn't caught on and  turn it into a smashing success? I have decades of experience implementing and driving the adoption of software. {  I can also do quick and dirty small projects(?) }

**Level Up Your Analytics Infrastructure.** Want to transform your organization's sprawling collection of databases, analytics tools, and squirreled-away spreadsheets into a unified self-service infrastructure that lets users easily take care of most of their needs and produces real value in achieving your organization's goals? I can assess your existing setup and collaboratively develop  a vision and roadmap.  I can also manage part or all of the transformation so you can start racking up small wins right away and iteratively, sustainably build bigger successes.

**Tech Leadership Development.** Now that your software needs are rapidly expanding and are even more critical to your organization's success, do you need to develop your staff's skills in managing software projects? As generative AI takes off, do you want your nontechnical staff to dip their toes in the water to see if you can use AI to expand your organization's technical capacity? I have decades of experience as a trainer, coach, and mentor. And I specialize in helping diverse groups of people who are intimidated by tech become
skilled, confident project managers, analysts, or developers. 


### Dramatically Improving Database Developer and Analyst Support Services

Need to move the quality and timeliness of your Analyst or Database Developer support team's work up to the next level? I have 15 years of experience managing professional tech support services in large and small nonprofits.  I am an expert in iteratively, sustainably transforming a team's work and relationship with other units. I use an approach that empowers users and support teams, creating more autonomy and accountability across the board. The end result: an environment where both sides are happier and feel they are treated with dignity and respect.


### Transforming Your Organization's Data Culture

Want your organization to become more data driven but having difficulty getting traction? I have over 20 years of experience helping organizations iteratively, organically develop  a more data-driven culture.  

## What Makes Enode Consulting Services Unique

By the time I was finishing up my UC Berkeley PhD in Sociology, I realized I didn't want to just study grassroots groups from the sidelines. Instead, I wanted to leverage my years of experience as a developer and IT manager with my newfound skills in organizational development to help these groups flourish. So I've spent the past few decades in the trenches, working for unions -- including 7 years at SEIU --  other nonprofits, government, and startups.  As a result, I'm equally skilled at nerding out with techies, collaborating with hard-charging organizers and fundraisers, and brainstorming with senior staff on solving the tricky political and cultural challenges of organizational change. 

Whether you’re a tech manager, a fundraising director, or a CEO, I can help you build on your organization’s strengths and find a smart, strategic way to use  tech to help your organization thrive.
