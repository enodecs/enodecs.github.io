You know your organization can perform at a higher level if you can figure out how to more effectively use technology. Here's how Enode Consulting Services can help. 

## What Makes Enode Consulting Services Unique

My name is Anders Schneiderman, and I've spent the past few decades working for nonprofits, unions -- including 7 years at SEIU --  government, and startups.   I'm equally skilled at nerding out with techies, collaborating with hard-charging organizers and fundraisers, and brainstorming with senior staff on solving the tricky political and cultural challenges of organizational change. I also have over 20 years of experience helping organizations iteratively, organically develop  a more data-driven culture. For more details, see my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/anders-schneiderman-1030525).

  { here's how I work with people.  I think most successful in helping every one feel more capable and empowered. I want to work with and skill up your people.  coaching and working on projects together  is usually less expensive and also build your capacity}. 
  Whether you’re a tech manager, a fundraising director, or a CEO, I can help you build on your organization’s strengths and find a smart, strategic way to use  tech to help your organization thrives.

## The Types of Work I Provide

### Tech Coaching

Now that your software needs are rapidly expanding and are even more critical to your organization's success, do you need to develop your staff's skills in managing software projects?
As generative AI takes off, are you interested in having your nontechnical staff to dip their toes in the water to see if you can use AI to expand your organization's technical capacity? I have decades of experience as a trainer, coach, and mentor. I specialize in coaching software project management, creating a data-driven  culture, and programming in Python, SQL, and 
Javascript (for creative data visualization).  I specialize in helping diverse groups of people who are intimidated by tech become
skilled, confident project managers, analysts, or developers.  My coaching practice includes one time projects and ongoing monthly coaching.


### Onboard or Revamp  Your EveryAction/VAN Site

Starting from scratch with EveryAction and VAN or need to transform your existing setup?  I've got years of experience as a contractor for the company now known as Bonterra and have helped dozens of large and small nonprofits get more out of these powerful fundraising and organizing tools. [ Clients have included NEA, America Votes, State Voices, Working Families Party, Amnesty International, United Way NY, La Familia Vota, Civic Nation, Equality Utah, ACLU Massachusetts, Indiana Voices, Alliance for Justice, MASSCreative, and North Carolina Justice Center. ]

### Level Up Your Analytics Infrastructure 

Want to transform your organization's sprawling collection of databases, analytics tools, and squirreled-away spreadsheets into a unified self-service infrastructure that lets users easily take care of most of their needs and produces real value in achieving your organization's goals? I can assess your existing setup and collaboratively develop  a vision and roadmap.  I can also manage part or all of the transformation so you can start racking up small wins right away and iteratively, sustainably build bigger successes.

### Dramatically Improve Database Developer and Analyst Support Services

Need to move the quality and timeliness of your Analyst or Database Developer support team's work up to the next level? I have 15 years of experience managing professional tech support services in large and small nonprofits.  I am an expert in iteratively, sustainably transforming a team's work and relationship with other units. I use an approach that empowers both users and support teams, creating more autonomy and accountability across the board. The end result: an environment where both sides are happier and feel they are treated with dignity and respect.

### Implement and Adopt Software

Need someone to plan and manage the implementation of a new software system?  Want some help  taking a system you spent so much time developing but still hasn't caught on and  turning it into a smashing success? I have decades of experience implementing and driving the adoption of software, and I'm equally interested in large and small projects.
