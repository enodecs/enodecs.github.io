You know your organization can perform at a higher level if you can figure out how to strategically use  technology. Enode Consulting Services can help:

### EveryAction/VAN

Starting from scratch with EveryAction and VAN or need to massively improve your existing set up?  I've got years of experience as a contractor for Bonterra and have help dozens of large and small non profits get more out of it from organizing to fundraising.

### Implementing, Adopting, And Transforming Complex Software

{ decades of experience }

{ plenty of consultants can implement a new system. but just as hard is getting folks to use and get more out of what you've heavily invested in}

{ and can also coach and mentor on how to do this}

{ already got one or more complicated systems and feel frustrated you aren't getting more out of them? I specialize in ungunking big, hairy problems}

{ but I can also do quick and dirty small projects}


### Improving Developer Or Analyst Services

{self service, iteratively incrementally moving towards more empowering approach where users, developers, and managers are happier and everyone is treated with more respect}
