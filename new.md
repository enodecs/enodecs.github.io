You know your organization can perform at a higher level if you can figure out how to more effectively use your tech. Enode Consulting Services can help:

### Using EveryAction/VAN

Starting from scratch with EveryAction and VAN or need to transform your existing set up?  I've got years of experience as a contractor for Bonterra and have helped dozens of large and small nonprofits get more out of it from organizing to fundraising.

### Implementing, Adopting, And Transforming Software

Need someone to plan and manage the implementation of a new software system?  Or could use some assistance in taking the system you spent so much time developing that hasn't really caught on and figure out how to turn it into a smashing success? I have decades of experience implementing and adopting software.

Want to transform your organization's collection of analytics tools, databases, and assorted piles of spread sheets into a unified infrastructure that lets users easily take care of most of their needs and consistently produces real value in achieving your organization's goals? I can assess your existing setup, collaboratively develop a vision and a roadmap for making this transformation, and manage this transformation so you start racking up small wins right away and iteratively, sustainably create bigger successes.

Now that your software needs are getting increasingly complex and more critical to your organization's success, could you use some help in developing your staff's skills in managing software projects? Or as generative AI is starting to take off, want your non technical staff to dip their toes in the water to see if you can expand your organization's technical capacity? I have decades of experience as a trainer, coach, and mentor, am I specializing in helping diverse groups of people who are intimidated by tech into skilled, confident users.
