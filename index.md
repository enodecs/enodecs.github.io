You know your organization can perform at a higher level if you can figure out how to strategically use new technology. For example:

- Become a data-driven organization by using analytics and exploring machine learning/AI
- Strategically embrace augmented and virtual reality

But you’ve been burned before. You’ve seen tech fads eat up a lot of resources without helping your organization achieve its goals.

Why do most tech transformations fail? The key driver isn’t tech but people — problems with management, processes, organizational culture, and internal politics.

At Enode, we’re tech experts but we also understand the critical importance of focusing on people. 

Whether you’re a tech manager, a marketing director, or a CEO, we can help you build on your organization’s strengths and find a smarter way to use new technology to “level up” your organization.

# Services

We provide the following services:

### Strategic Planning
- For the technology you want your organization to adopt, such as data science or augmented/virtual reality, we’ll help you flesh out your goals and assumptions; assess your organization’s technical, organizational, and cultural strengths & weaknesses; and briefly map out where the field is headed.  
- We’ll provide you with some options and a recommendation so you can choose a strategy that best fits your organization’s goals and capacity.
- We’ll collaboratively develop a roadmap and a plan that gets your feet wet, rack up some small wins, then iteratively builds success on top of success.

### Coaching and Project Management
- Instead of hiring an army of consultants to do everything, we believe the most cost-efficient, sustainable way to make big changes is to invest in developing your staff. We can coach individuals and teams to gain the skills, processes, and team culture they need to help transform your organization.
- We can also manage part or all of your tech transformation project for you.

### Writing
- Documentation, tutorials, and other technical writing
- Policy papers and other white papers
